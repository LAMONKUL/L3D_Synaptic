# Image Processing and Statistical Analysis Pipelines

This repository contains scripts and workflows developed for image processing and statistical analysis across different software environments. The code is organized into subdirectories based on the programming language or platform used:

- [`R/`](./R): Scripts and utilities written in **R**  
- [`Python/`](./Python): Scripts and notebooks written in **Python**  
- [`Matlab/`](./Matlab): Pipelines and tools implemented in **MATLAB**

Each subfolder contains a dedicated `README.md` file with detailed information about the respective scripts, dependencies, and usage instructions.
